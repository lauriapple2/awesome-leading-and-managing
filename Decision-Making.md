- [Act Last, Read the Room, and Taste the Soup](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/act-last-read-the-room-and-taste-the-soup) - by Rands in Repose. Takeaway: In times of decision-making, it's best to go last in expressing your views because by this time, everyone else has provided context you'll need to make the best decision. Also, take the temperature of whatever room you're in so you can communicate effectively, and don't micromanage.

- [Battling Perfectionism](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/battling-perfectionism-713537a8b8b6) - by Julie Zhuo. Takeaway: "The problem is that trying to do things perfectly all the time often leads to worse prioritization decisions when you take a step back...The thing is, perfectionism tends to be rooted in fear rather than opportunity."

- [Business Value Game](https://www.agile42.com/en/business-value-game/) - by Andrea Tomasini. Takeaway: an interactive game in which a "product management board" of stakeholders decides, in a manner inspired by Planning Poker, which goals to prioritize based on relative value to the business.

- [Cost Per Reasonable Decision (CPRD)](https://cutle.fish/blog/cost-per-reasonable-decision-cprd) - by John Cutler. Takeaway: "[W]e want rapid throughput of small, safe-to-fail decisions, coupled with focus and attention on the high-level strategic decisions that will set the course for the org for months/years...Consider the irony that many orgs spend $50k to make a single decision over work that will take two weeks to actually implement and test."

- [Debiasing the Corporation: An Interview with Nobel Laureate Richard Thaler](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/debiasing-the-corporation-an-interview-with-nobel-laureate-richard-thaler) - by Bill Javetski and Tim Koller.

- [Decision-Making Auditing](http://tomtunguz.com/decision-making-auditing/) - by Tomasz Tunguz. Takeaway: "I’ll never know as much about a company’s operations or strategy or a sector as a founder/management team. But, I still want to be helpful. So, the most effective strategy I’ve found so far is to probe how the decision was made. Answer a question with a trenchant question, which coincidentally, ties back to some of the best advice I’ve received from a founder."
 
 - [Decision Making in a Company with No Managers](https://www.infoq.com/articles/decisions-company-no-managers) - by Jan Zborowski. Takeaway: Ensuring a safe decision-making environment for all employees is a must in a self-managed company. Letting ordinary employees propose an idea and then implement it, to jointly shape the company’s future, results in a low rotation indicator. A flat and transparent business model translates directly into clients’ happiness and a company’s growth.
 
- [“Do We All Agree” Is a Terrible Question](https://medium.com/@hunterwalk/do-we-all-agree-is-a-terrible-question-14499769591b) - by Hunter Walk. Takeaway: We often confuse 'collaboration' with 'consensus.' The former is about engaging a group of people to work together and discuss ideas.

Takeaway: Understand that leaving your job as a manager is a process with emotions involved.

- [How We Make Decisions at Coinbase](https://medium.com/@barmstrong/how-we-make-decisions-at-coinbase-cd6c630322e9) - by Brian Armstrong. Takeaway: "The vast majority of decisions in a company are low-risk and should be made unilaterally by the owner of that area (e.g. should we move the stand up meeting from Mon to Tues this week). A decision-making framework is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is higher risk. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made." Includes a decision-making template.

- [Know Thyself: The Power of a Decision Journal](http://www.samkyle.com/decision-journal/) - by Sam Kyle. Takeaway: The author of *The Decision Checklist: A Practical Guide to Avoiding Problems* makes the case for keeping a journal of decisions. "A decision journal will help you to slow down, reflect on and understand your decisions, and provide a path for you to get better. In the end, taking the time to think through problems will save you time. Not only will you make better initial decisions, but you’ll spend less time cleaning up the mess of poor ones." 

- [The 90% Agreement Rule](https://hackernoon.com/the-90-agreement-rule-36757dcc8eaa) - by Lawrence Ripsher. Takeaway: Ripsher asserts that "we spend 90% of our time, talking about the 10% of things we disagree on." This takes up time and energy. Instead, "[c]reate clarity (and build on) wherever there is ‘about 90% agreement’ first— then come back around and address the disagreements after."

- [Ruthless Prioritization](https://blackboxofpm.com/ruthless-prioritization-e4256e3520a9) — by Brandon Chu.

- [Second-Order Thinking: What Smart People Use to Outperform](https://www.fs.blog/2016/04/second-level-thinking/) - by Farnham Street. Takeaway: "Second-order thinkers take into account a lot of what we put into our decision journals. Things like, What is the range of possible outcomes? What’s the probability I’m right? What’s the follow-on? How could I be wrong? The real difference for me is that first-order thinkers are the people that look for things that are simple, easy, and defendable. Second-order thinkers push harder and don't accept the first conclusion."

- [Some Heuristics to Make Decisions](https://twitter.com/farnamstreet/status/1026105498372845571) - by Shane Parrish. Takeaway: a Twitter thread of heuristics for framing and assessing situations so that you can make better decisions. Parrish invites you to add your own ideas to the thread.

Takeaway: An interview with psychologist Daniel Kahneman and scientist Gary Klein. “Society’s epitome of credibility is John Wayne, who sizes up a situation and says, ‘Here’s what I’m going to do’—and you follow him. We both worry about leaders in complex situations who don’t have enough experience, who are just going with their intuition and not monitoring it, not thinking about it.”—Klein.

- [3 Ways to Ease the Pain of Slow and Frustrating Decision Making](http://corporate-rebels.com/rebellious-practices-distributed-authority/) - by the Corporate Rebels.

This means they end up making more informed decisions than those who need to be right and ignore evidence.

- [Why Leaders Who Listen Achieve Breakthroughs](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Why-Leaders-Who-Listen-Achieve-Breakthroughs?__s=ns1epkqjs8qj1ggjuafv) - by Elizabeth Doty.

Decisions become better and more reflective/inclusive of different perspectives and information sources.
